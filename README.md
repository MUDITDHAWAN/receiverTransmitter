Components Type Purpose
    HC-49U Crystal Oscillator: Generate 2MHz signal
    CD4017BE Frequency Divider:  Convert 2MHz signal to 40KHz signal
    CD4049 Buffer Amplifier:  Allows for impedance transformation and protects
        circuits from fluctuations in currents.
    MCUSD16A40S12R0 Piezoelectric Transducer: Convert electrical to ultrasonic signal and back
        (Transmitter and Receiver)
    MC33079 Low Noise Amplifier: Amplify received signal without introducing too much
        noise
